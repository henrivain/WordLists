# WordListsApp
Way to learn word lists easily!
 
## Why?
I wrote this app because I didn't find any other service that could meet my all expectations.   
This was also a great opportunity to learn new ui framework .NET MAUI which I am interested in.   

## What I wanted the app to do?
- Learn words in flipcard style
- Set words as "learned" so I don't need to always go through every word
- Maybe write the words and then validate my input?
- Make app usable in offline mode

## How to use?
- App is currently only in finnish, but if you are interested in other languages, you can contact the owner

### Installation

#### Android 

1) Click [Releases (Latest)](https://github.com/matikkaeditorinkaantaja/WordLists/releases)  
2) Assets / Wordlists_Android-Signed_vX.X.X.apk  
3) You may be prompted to enable loading apps from internet, when you try to run downloaded .apk file
4) When your device's installer has stopped, you can start the app like any other app

#### Windows 

- not easy currently, releasing to windows is currently a bit hard in .NET MAUI
- You can copy source code and build it yourself
- Msix package doesn't seem to install currently because of lack of the digital signature

#### Launching for the first time
After launching the app you are in the home page  
By default you dont have any wordlists to train, so let's create on for you!  
Go to word list generator page by clicking "Luo uusi sanasto"  &rarr;

You will be navigated to word list generator page  
The page will look something like this one below  

Give your list name by typing it to "Otsikko" field

You can specify which languages the list uses like finnish and english as "fi-en", the languages should match:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;right language with right side words and left language for leftside words, because left side words are seen as native words and right language will help you later

You have three ways to create the words  
- from clipboard
- by adding on at the time
- (on windows you can generate from image, this will be added later)
